### Distributed Ledger

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions performed on assets that are part of the system. This ledger is immutable and once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be modified or tampered. The management of the blockchain is decentralized across nodes in the network and all the nodes create consensus about what blocks should be included in the blockchain.

### Smart Contract

Smart contracts define what are the things you can do (i.e. transactions) on the assets that are part of the system. Smart contracts are implemented as small programs.
